Project Overview

In this project, needle nose pliers that could grasp and pick up through-hole resistors were designed and 3D printed. Since the pliers are a print-in-place model, no assembly or post-processing is necessary; they start working as soon as they are taken out of the print bed. But for flexibility, a three-part, hand-pressed assembly with two rigid handles and an elastic spring component was permitted.

What is Print-in-Place?

3D-printed designs with several moving pieces that don't need to be assembled further are called print-in-place models. In order to preserve component clearances and allow for instant motion and functionality upon printing, these models depend on exact design and print orientation. Joints, hinges, and mechanical components for both toys and useful equipment frequently use print-in-place models. To increase the robustness and functionality of the printed items, they frequently combine stiff and flexible materials, such as TPU for flexibility and rigid PLA for structure.

Design Process

Material Selection: For this project, we chose TPU for the flexible spring component at the center of the pliers, providing elasticity and durability essential for returning the pliers to the open position. PLA was used for the rigid handles and jaws, offering the structural integrity needed for effective gripping.

Spring Design: The spring was designed as an extruded square with strategically placed smaller square cutouts. This design enhances flexibility by allowing the material to bend more easily while preserving the overall stability and strength needed for repeated use.

Tolerances and Fits: We implemented a zero tolerance design, creating geometries with an exact fit. This ensures that the components fit tightly and securely, supporting smooth operation and reducing any need for post-processing adjustments.

Print Settings
Material: TPU for the spring and PLA for the rigid handles and jaw.
Layer Height: 0.2 mm

Iterative Process

Throughout the project, 2 prototypes were printed to refine the pliersâ€™ fit, flexibility, and function. 

First Iteration:
A 0.6 mm nozzle was used the the dovetails connecting the pieces were not precise enough nor angled enough to prevent the pieces from falling apart.

Second Iteration:
A 0.4 mm nozzle was used for both parts leading to higher accuracy with parts. Additionally, steeper angles on the dovetail features wer incorporated in order to prevent bending from disassembling the plier parts.
