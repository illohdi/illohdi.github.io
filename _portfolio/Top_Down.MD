## Top-Down Modeling and Design Rationale

In this assignment, a top-down modeling approach was used to design a phone holder for a bike or scooter. The design process began by importing the handlebars and phone into the CAD workspace, grounding them, and using these as reference components for creating the holder. By driving the design from the handlebars and phone, I ensured the holder would fit securely, allowing for quick attachment and rotation of the phone without the need for tools.

The rationale behind the design was to use parts that could be connected with minimal clearance between geometries, facilitating secure connections through as-built joints. This approach also enabled the phone holder to rotate between landscape and portrait orientations simply by detaching and reattaching the phone holder in the desired position. The design aimed to ensure the phone remained secure during use, with road vibrations being absorbed through tight-fitting joints that do not interfere with the phone's functionality.

## Assembly Instructions

The assembly process involves inserting the holder into the square cut on both the ring for the handlebar and the phone holder. The connection between the components ensures stability, while also allowing for easy detachment and reattachment to change the phone's orientation. 

## Material Choice

I chose PLA for the material due to its rigid properties, which are crucial for creating secure connections and precise fits. PLA provides the necessary stability for the phone holder and is also relatively easy to 3D print with, making it a suitable choice for the project.
